# The Unified Workspace

## This project

- Builds a tiny image with:
    - The utilities, compilers, interpreters, and package managers I use. 
    - My shell, tmux, and neovim configs.
    - Git, podman, and OpenSSH
    - A single admin user with passwordless sudo
    - Ssh login access to that user for all public keys in `authorized_keys`
- Starts a container that:
    - Mounts the host user's ssh keys
    - Mounts the host user's `~/projects` folder
    - Publishes it's SSH port on the host at `:22222`

This environment lives on my homeserver and is used as a single workspace that can be accessed by my household's many clients. It offers a declarative, atomic environment that unites each of my devices into one tmux session and one set of git worktree states. 

## To deploy

### Requirements

To deploy the unified workspace you will need a relatively modern x86 Linux host with:
 - Sudo
 - Podman
 - Static network address (_I recommend a DHCP entry, netbios name, or local DNS entry - avoid exposing this to the internet as it mounts the host's private key_)

### Steps

On your intended host:

1. `git clone https://github.com/TadghW/workspace-container.git`
2. `cd workspace-container`
3. `git submodule update --init --recursive` (see "Customise!" if you don't want my config)
4.  Set the `USER`, `USER_GIT_EMAIL`, and `USER_GIT_NAME` `ARG`s at the top of `Dockerfile`
5.  Populate `authorized_keys` with the public ssh keys of the client devices you intend to access the space with
6.  Replace the network address in `start-workspace.sh` and `refresh-workspace.sh` with the address you intend to use
7.  Run `build-workspace-image.sh` and `start-workspace.sh` - (or one-shot it with `refresh-workspace.sh`!)

## Notes
- `sshd` is the container entrypoint and `start-workspace.sh` and `refresh-workspace.sh` assume you want port forwarding for easy access - but you can attach with `attach-to-workspace.sh` if you want to run locally
- `sshd` is run with flags `-D -e` and will pipe logs to stderr - if you run into issues accessing the workspace over SSH check the logs from the host with `sudo podman logs workspace-container`
- `start-workspace.sh` and `refresh-workspace.sh` rw mount the host's ~/projects folder because that's where I expect to work, that's not a magic folder just my personal convention
- There's a loop in `start-workspace.sh` and `refresh-workspace.sh` that looks for id_rsa and id_ed25519 keys on the host to ro mount to the container. If you have another key type you want mounted add it to line 8 (`for key in id_ed25519... rsa; do`).

## Customise!

To customise the workspace:

- `Dockerfile` exposes the arguments: `UID`, `GID`, `USER`, `GROUP`, `USER_GIT_EMAIL`, `USER_GIT_NAME`, `USER_GIT_DEFAULT_BRANCH`
- Make sure you have all of the packages you want on the apk install list in at the top of the `Dockerfile`
- Replace my `dotfiles` submodule with your own dotfiles
- Remove the `ohmyposh` and `catppuccin-tmux` install lines (unless you want them)
- Replace my `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` installs with whatever shell you prefer
- Replace my `authorized_keys` file with your own list of trusted devices

## To-do:
- It would be painless and fruitful to expand the list of key types assembled in `start-workspace.sh` and `refresh-workspace.sh`
- Workspace currently builds its own SSH host keys at build time. This sucks: each rebuild will change the server identity which trips SSH host key warnings on clients. You can get around this with by clearing your host key entry for the host, but a better approach would be the programmatic creation of dedicated persistent host key sets for the container when the user first runs `start-workspace.sh` and `refresh-workspace.sh` and mounting those host keys to the container.
